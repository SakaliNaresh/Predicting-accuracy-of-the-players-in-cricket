# Predicting-accuracy-of-the-players-in-cricket

INTRODUCTION

PROJECT SCOPE 
The proposed system lays the groundwork for future research and development in 
cricket analytics by allowing for the refinement and optimization of machine learning 
algorithms for player accuracy prediction, including the exploration of advanced techniques 
like deep learning and ensemble methods to enhance model robustness. Additionally, it can 
be extended to incorporate diverse data sources and performance metrics, such as player 
biometrics, match conditions, and situational analysis, providing a comprehensive 
understanding of player accuracy and enabling more nuanced predictions tailored to specific 
game scenarios.  

PROJECT PURPOSE 
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning-based approach for 
predicting the performance and accuracy of cricket players by analyzing historical player 
statistics. By employing various machine learning algorithms and feature selection 
techniques, the project aims to create predictive models that can assist coaches, team selectors, 
and analysts in making informed decisions about player selection, strategy formulation, and 
performance improvement. Ultimately, the methodology can also be adapted for use in other 
sports to enhance performance prediction and analysis.

PROJECT FEATURES 

This project leverages a comprehensive dataset of historical player 
statistics, including key metrics like batting and bowling averages, strike rates, and fielding 
statistics. It employs various machine learning algorithms—such as linear regression, decision 
trees, random forests, and support vector machines—for effective model comparison. 
Advanced feature selection enhances accuracy by identifying relevant attributes, while 
performance is evaluated using metrics like mean absolute error and R-squared value. The 
project provides actionable insights for coaches and analysts, aiding informed decisions on 
player selection and strategy. Its scalable methodology allows for integration of additional 
data sources, making it adaptable to other sports and laying the foundation for future research 
in sports analytics
